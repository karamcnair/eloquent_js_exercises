// Functions in JavaScript are objects. Objects are collections of name/value 
// pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object. Objects produced from 
// object literals are linked to Object.prototype. Function objects are 
// linked to Function.prototype (which is itself linked to Object.prototype). 
// Every function is also created with two additional hidden properties: the 
// function's context and the code that implements the function's behavior.

// Every function object is also created with a prototype property. Its value 
// is an object with a constructor property whose value is the function. This is 
// distinct from the hidden link to Function.prototype. The meaning of this 
// convoluted construction will be revealed in the next chapter.
